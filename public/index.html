        <p>There are some parts of JavaScript we’ve all never touched before (unless you’re like a grand-wizard of JS or something. But I’m assuming you, like me, are not). Some parts are good, lots are bad, but regardless, when you actually find something good it changes the way you write your code.</p>
        <p>Let me give you an example of one of the stupidest things that I was doing, all because I didn’t know there was a better way to do it. All the facepalms.</p>
        <p>I've been writing a lot of module-based stuff (and eating a lot of ice cream) lately, and so it’s common that I’ll have an object like this:</p>
        <p>Okay so this is a little `IceCream` object that has a list of flavors, as well as a new flavor to be added. We call the `addNewFlavor()` method and it loops through the existing flavors to make sure the new one doesn’t already exist in our list.</p>
        <p>This of course is an extreme simplification, I just wanted to get the key concepts out there so people don’t make the same (dumb) mistakes as me! Ask me anything you need, and when in doubt read the docs!</p>
